## Recommendation

### üèÜ **Recommended: Vercel**

For PixieSketch, **Vercel** is the better choice for the following reasons:

1. **Performance**: With a drawing transformation app, users expect fast load times. Vercel's superior edge network ensures better global performance.

2. **User Experience**: The app involves file uploads and AI transformations. Faster initial loads improve perceived performance while waiting for transformations.

3. **Scalability**: As your user base grows, Vercel's infrastructure scales better without configuration changes.

4. **Developer Experience**: Better error tracking and analytics help you monitor the app's health and user experience.

5. **Build Performance**: Unlimited build minutes mean you can iterate faster without worrying about quotas.

6. **Future-Proofing**: If you later want to add API routes or edge functions (non-Supabase), Vercel's platform is more flexible.

### Alternative Consideration

Choose **Netlify** if:
- You prefer simpler, more predictable pricing
- You're already familiar with Netlify's ecosystem
- You want to use Netlify's form handling or identity features
- You prefer Netlify's community and plugin ecosystem

## Deployment Guide

### Deploying PixieSketch to Vercel

#### Prerequisites
- GitHub repository: `https://github.com/BuildTechDeployAiAgency/pixieSketchAi`
- Vercel account (free at vercel.com)
- Environment variables ready

#### Step 1: Connect to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your repository: `BuildTechDeployAiAgency/pixieSketchAi`

#### Step 2: Configure Build Settings

Vercel will auto-detect Vite, but verify:

```
Framework Preset: Vite
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: npm install
```

#### Step 3: Environment Variables

Add these in Vercel's dashboard:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
```

#### Step 4: Deploy Settings

1. **Root Directory**: Leave blank (uses repository root)
2. **Node.js Version**: 18.x
3. **Environment**: Production

#### Step 5: Deploy

1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. Access your app at `your-project.vercel.app`

#### Step 6: Custom Domain

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed
4. SSL certificate auto-provisions

#### Step 7: Configure Redirects

Create `vercel.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
          "value": "1; mode=block"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Update Supabase Allowed URLs**
   - Add `https://your-domain.com` to Supabase Auth settings
   - Update CORS settings for your domain

2. **Update Stripe Webhooks**
   - Add your production URL to Stripe webhook endpoints
   - Update success/cancel URLs in payment functions

3. **Monitor Performance**
   - Enable Vercel Analytics (Pro feature)
   - Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals

4. **Set Up CI/CD**
   - Automatic deploys are already configured
   - Add build checks for TypeScript/ESLint
   - Configure preview deploy comments

### Environment-Specific Configurations

#### Production
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your-key
```

#### Preview/Staging
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-staging-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-staging-anon-key
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your-key
```

## Conclusion

Both Netlify and Vercel are excellent choices for deploying PixieSketch. Vercel edges ahead with superior performance, better developer experience, and more generous build limits. However, the actual deployment process is nearly identical for both platforms, so you can easily switch between them if needed.

The key to success with either platform is:
1. Proper environment variable configuration
2. Correct build settings for Vite
3. SPA routing configuration
4. CORS setup with Supabase

Your Supabase Edge Functions will continue to run on Supabase's infrastructure regardless of where you host your frontend, ensuring your backend functionality remains unchanged.

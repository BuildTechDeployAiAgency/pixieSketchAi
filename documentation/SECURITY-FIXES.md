# Security Fixes Implemented

## Overview
This document summarizes the security improvements made to the PixieSketchAI application to protect against API abuse, credit system bypasses, and unauthorized access.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Authentication on All API Endpoints
- **analyze-drawing**: Now requires valid JWT authentication
- **process-sketch**: Now requires valid JWT authentication
- Both functions verify user session before processing any requests
- Returns 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated requests

### 2. ✅ Server-Side Credit System
- Credits are now checked and deducted server-side BEFORE processing
- Removed client-side credit deduction (was easily bypassed)
- Added optimistic locking to prevent race conditions
- Credits are refunded if processing fails
- Returns 402 Payment Required if insufficient credits

### 3. ✅ Rate Limiting
- **analyze-drawing**: 10 requests per minute per user
- **process-sketch**: 5 requests per minute per user (expensive operation)
- Returns 429 Too Many Requests with Retry-After header
- In-memory rate limiting (consider Redis for production)

### 4. ✅ Input Validation
- Server-side validation of image data format and size
- Base64 format validation
- 50MB file size limit enforced server-side
- Proper error messages for invalid inputs

### 5. ✅ CORS Security
- Configured allowed origins (localhost:8080, pixiesketchai.com)
- Proper preflight handling
- Restricted methods to POST, OPTIONS only

### 6. ✅ Removed Security Backdoors
- Removed hardcoded special user with 500 free credits
- All users now start with standard 10 credits

### 7. ✅ Database Security (RLS Policies)
- Created `rls-policies.sql` with comprehensive Row Level Security
- Users can only access their own data
- Proper indexes for performance
- Check constraints for data integrity

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Apply RLS Policies**: Run the SQL in `rls-policies.sql` in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Update CORS Origins**: Update allowed origins when deploying to production
3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all API keys are properly secured

### Medium Priority
1. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and alerting for suspicious activity
2. **Rate Limiting**: Consider Redis for distributed rate limiting
3. **API Key Rotation**: Implement regular API key rotation

### Low Priority
1. **Security Headers**: Add additional security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
2. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct security audit before launch
3. **Bug Bounty**: Consider bug bounty program for ongoing security

## Testing the Security

1. **Test Authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Should fail with 401
   curl -X POST https://yourproject.supabase.co/functions/v1/analyze-drawing \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt":"test","imageUrl":"test"}'
   ```

2. **Test Rate Limiting**:
   - Make 6+ requests within 1 minute to process-sketch
   - Should receive 429 error after 5th request

3. **Test Credit System**:
   - Create user with 0 credits
   - Try to process an image
   - Should receive 402 error

## Important Notes

- The Supabase anon key in client code is expected and safe (it's meant to be public)
- Service role key should NEVER be in client code
- Always use environment variables for sensitive keys
- Enable RLS on all tables in production
- Monitor your OpenAI API usage to prevent abuse
